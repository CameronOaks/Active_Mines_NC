Active Mines in North Carolina 
---
 The purpose of this map is to use data collected from the [NC Dept. of Environmental Quality Online GIS](https://data-ncdenr.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/391619a31dfc4c2fbda8cb5a7d68fd8e/explore?filters=eyJNSU5FX1NUQVRVUyI6WyJBY3RpdmUiXSwiQ09NTU9ESVRZX0NPREUiOlsiU2FuZCBhbmQgR3JhdmVsIiwiQ3J1c2hlZCBTdG9uZSJdfQ%3D%3D&location=35.211423%2C-78.960731%2C7.00) and use it to show the number of active mines in North Carolina with that data. While also using [NC County data](https://www.nconemap.gov/datasets/9728285994804c8b9f20ce58bae45899/explore?location=34.971222%2C-78.814719%2C6.74) to produce a choropleth map, combining these two to make a bivariate map. 

This project was inspired by a recent news article reporting on the recent acquisition of 20 aggregate mines in the south by [Martin Marrieta](https://www.martinmarietta.com). This map shows how a majority of the mines in the state are aggreagate mines. [Here](https://businessnc.com/martin-marietta-buying-20-aggregates-mines-for-2-billion) is a link to the article. Some of there useful links that pretain to the map are [NC mineral resources](https://www.deq.nc.gov/about/divisions/energy-mineral-land-resources/north-carolina-geological-survey/mineral-resources/mineral-resources-faq#:~:text=Industrial%20minerals%20are%20mined%20thoughout,crushed%20stone%20and%20dimension%20stone.), and [Aggregate](https://uwaterloo.ca/earth-sciences-museum/resources/detailed-rocks-and-minerals-articles/aggregate).
